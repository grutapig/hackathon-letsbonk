# ü§ñ AI Agent for Detecting FUD in Crypto Communities

## üìã Problem Description

In crypto communities on the X platform, the issue of **professional FUD** (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) is widespread. Many promising crypto projects face actions from FUDders‚Äîmarket makers, competitors, organized groups of shorters from centralized exchanges (CEX), or individuals aiming to buy tokens at a discounted price.

FUDders cause significant damage to the reputation of projects and their communities. Group administrators often struggle to promptly identify FUDders, who disguise themselves as regular investors asking questions or gain trust by posting positive content before abruptly switching to negativity.

The author personally encountered this issue in the $‚Äî‚Äî community, observing FUDders' tactics over two months and attempting to counteract them. This experience inspired the idea for a hackathon project: developing an AI agent to help crypto group administrators or any twitter user who is our client detect potential FUDders at early stages, minimizing reputational and financial risks for projects and their communities.

## üí° MVP Idea

The MVP is an AI agent trained on data from a group subjected to FUD attacks over 1.5 months. The agent analyzes group messages and alerts the administrator and other twitter users client our AI agent about posts likely containing FUD or serving as precursors to it (preventive warnings). It also flags users who posted suspicious messages.

Functions like automatic message deletion, user blocking, or post replies are not included to avoid errors that could deter genuine investors. The decision on further actions remains with the group administrator.

## üîÑ Main Algorithm Workflow

### 1. **Community Monitoring**
The bot connects to crypto communities via TwitterAPI.io for real-time monitoring of new messages.

### 2. **Initial Message Analysis**
Each new message undergoes a quick check for FUD markers, considering the user's prior message history (limited context).

### 3. **In-Depth Analysis of Suspicious Users**
Upon detecting potential FUD, an extended analysis is triggered:

- Scanning all available user tweets (within API limits)
- Analyzing the user's followers and following lists
- Extracting the full context of the discussion thread

### 4. **AI Analysis**
Collected data is processed using AI to determine the likelihood of FUD activity and classify the type of FUD. The analysis is based on insights gained from manually processing over 10,000 community messages to identify FUD patterns, strategies, and behavioral factors for fine-tuning the detection algorithms.

### 5. **Grading and Notification System**

#### üö® FUD Activity Levels:

| Level | Description | Threat Level |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Suspicious** | Requires monitoring | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low |
| **Likely FUDder** | Moderate threat | üü° Medium |
| **Confirmed FUDder** | High threat | üü† High |
| **Professional FUDder** | Critical threat | üî¥ Critical |

#### üì± Telegram-based Management System:

- All notifications sent directly to administrator or any client via Telegram bot
- Basic bot configuration and settings management through Telegram interface
- Real-time alerts with message text and AI decision rationale

### 6. **Development and Testing Infrastructure**

- Custom Twitter Emulator developed for debugging and testing
- Emulated API methods for comprehensive testing without rate limits
- Extensive testing environment for algorithm refinement
- Seamless integration between real APIs and testing environment

## üöÄ Optimization

- **User data cached** for set periods
- **Minimization** of repeated Twitter API requests
- **Confirmed FUDders**: simplified analysis of new messages without repeated in-depth analysis

## üèÜ Technical Achievement

The MVP leverages Twitter monitoring, custom development tools, and analysis insights from substantial real-world data processing, making it technically robust and achievable within the hackathon timeframe while providing a solid foundation for rapid prototyping and future scaling.
